I focus on building apps, websites, SDKs, and tools that solve real problems and help businesses grow.

I work with Node.js/Koa.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, and React.js/Next.js, and have strong experience in native JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (including building web SDKs). I’ve also spent 1 year developing apps for Shopify, creating extensions and working with Shopify’s REST and GraphQL APIs.

Additionally, I’ve built enterprise-level applications using Angular, RxJS, and Material-UI. I enjoy working with Angular for its structure and scalability, and I’ve used it to deliver clean, maintainable, and efficient solutions.

I’m always ready to put my skills to work and deliver results that matter. Let’s connect and build something great together!
